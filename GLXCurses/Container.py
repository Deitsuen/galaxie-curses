    """
    GLXCurses.Container — Base class for widgets which contain other widgets

    Description:

    A GLXCurse user interface is constructed by nesting widgets inside widgets. Container widgets are the
    inner nodes in the resulting tree of widgets: they contain other widgets. So, for example, you might have a
    GLXCurse.Window containing a GLXCurse.Frame containing a GLXCurse.Label. If you wanted an image instead of a
    textual label inside the frame, you might replace the GLXCurse.Label widget with a GLXCurse.Image widget.

    There are two major kinds of container widgets in GLXCurses. Both are subclasses of the abstract GLXCurse.Container
    base class.

    The first type of container widget has a single child widget and derives from GLXCurses.Bin. These containers are
    decorators, which add some kind of functionality to the child. For example, a GLXCurses.Button makes its child
    into a clickable button; a GLXCurses.Frame draws a frame around its child and a GLXCurses.Window places its child
    widget inside a top-level window.

    The second type of container can have more than one child; its purpose is to manage layout. This means that these
    containers assign sizes and positions to their children. For example, a GLXCurses.HBox arranges its children in a
    horizontal row, and a GLXCurses.Grid arranges the widgets it contains in a two-dimensional grid.

    For implementations of GLXCurses.Container the virtual method GLXCurses.Container.forall() is always required,
    since it's used for drawing and other internal operations on the children. If the GLXCurses.Container
    implementation expect to have non internal children it's needed to implement both GLXCurses.Container.add() and
    GLXCurses.Container.remove(). If the GLXCurses.Container implementation has internal children, they should be
    added widget.set_parent() on __init__() and removed with widget.unparent() in the GLXCurses.Widget.destroy()
    implementation. See more about implementing custom widgets at https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/CustomWidgets
